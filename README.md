openuserjs.org
==============

My Userscripts that were tobe hosted on [openuserjs.org](https://openuserjs.org/users/©TriMoon™/scripts)
Because that site changed their mind about their TOS, which in effect __BETRAYED__ their users, i am no longer going to use their hosting site...
See [issue #1](https://github.com/TriMoon/openuserjs.org/issues/1)
